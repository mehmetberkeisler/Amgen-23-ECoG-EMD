# Overcoming AC-DC Ambiguity
The project is divided into 2 main parts. First, we will examine synthetic data in 1-D and 2-D. Aftet exploring methods and different parameters we will switch to actual data.
In this repository:
-EMD like methods are compared on 1-D data via correlation and peak similarity
-Then 2-D data generator is created.
-Same methodology applied on 2-D
-Finally, real data trials are implemented
